# Library Setup Complete! ðŸŽ‰

Your project has been successfully converted into a installable Python library.

## What Was Done

### 1. Package Structure Created
```
gnns_ml/              # Main Python package
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py       # Package initialization with exports
â”œâ”€â”€ GNN.py           # Graph Neural Networks
â”œâ”€â”€ NeuralNetwork.py # Neural Networks  
â”œâ”€â”€ LinearRegression.py
â””â”€â”€ GraphAlgorithms.py

examples/             # Usage examples
â”œâ”€â”€ basic_usage_example.py
â””â”€â”€ test_data_nn.csv

setup.py              # Package installation script
CMakeLists.txt         # C++/CUDA build configuration
MANIFEST.in           # Package data inclusion
```

### 2. Installation

Users can now install your library:

```bash
# Development mode (editable install)
pip install -e .

# Normal install
pip install .
```

### 3. Usage

After installation:

```python
from gnns_ml import GNN, NeuralNetwork, LinearRegression, GraphAlgorithms
import numpy as np

# Use GNNs
gnn = GNN(input_dim=4, hidden_dims=[32, 16], output_dim=3, task_type="classification")

# Use Neural Networks
nn = NeuralNetwork(input_dim=10, hidden_dims=[32, 16], output_dim=2)

# Use Linear Regression
lr = LinearRegression(learning_rate=0.01)

# Use Graph Algorithms (class-based)
ga = GraphAlgorithms()
previsited, postvisited = ga.depth_first_search(graph)
distances = ga.dijkstra(graph, start=0)
mst = ga.prim(graph)
```

### 4. Example Usage

**Python examples:**
```bash
cd examples
py basic_usage_example.py
```

**C++/CUDA examples:**
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./bin/cpp_library_example      # C++ example
./bin/gnn_demo_cuda            # CUDA demo
```

### 5. Library Structure

You now have **three ways** to use the library:

1. **Python Package** (`pip install .`)
   - Use `from gnns_ml import GNN, NeuralNetwork, ...`
   - Install: `pip install -e .`

2. **C++ Library** (Static library)
   - Files: `libgnns_ml_cpp.a`
   - Use in your CMake project:
   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(your_project gnns_ml_cpp)
   include_directories(${GNNS_ML_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   ```

3. **CUDA Library** (Static library with GPU acceleration)
   - Files: `libgnns_ml_cuda.a`
   - Same API as C++ but GPU-accelerated
   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(your_project gnns_ml_cuda CUDA::cudart)
   ```

## Benefits for Your Resume

You can now say:

**"Built an installable Python library (gnns_ml) for GNNs..."**

Instead of:

**"Built a learning repository..."**

This is more professional and demonstrates production-ready code.

## Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add tests**: Create a `tests/` directory with pytest tests
2. **Add CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing
3. **Add documentation**: Sphinx docs or mkdocs
4. **Publish to PyPI**: Make it installable via `pip install gnns-from-scratch`

## Updated Resume Wording

```latex
\resumeItem{\textbf{Built an installable Python library (gnns_ml) for GNNs}, 
Neural Networks, and ML algorithmsâ€”implementations that can be pip-installed 
and used as a library in custom model development across C++, CUDA, and Python.}
```
