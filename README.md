# ML-From-Scratch
Classical Algorithms like Linear Regression, Deep Learning Algorithms like Neural Networks, GNNs, etc. from scratch in Python and C++.

I'm using this repository as a crash course to learning about GNNs in depth. As part of the process, I plan on implementing Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Djikstra's Algorithm, Boruvka’s Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Graph Traversals and GNNs. I am using Python to develop a quick, pseudo-code like implementation of these algorithms since I am comfortable with the language and will use this as a method to refresh the concepts. Later, I will use C++ in order to learn the language and work my skill up to building a GNN from scratch in C++. 

Structure : 
|
| - Python
| - / LinearRegression.py : A simplistic implementation of Linear Regression in Python.
| - / NeuralNetwork.py : A simple implementation of neural networks in Python.
| - / GraphAlgorithms.py : A collection of graph-related algorithms including Djikstra's Algorithm, Boruvka’s Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm and Graph Traversals in Python.
| - / GNN.py : An implementation of GNNs in Python.
| - C++
| - / LinearRegression.cpp : A simplistic implementation of Linear Regression in C++.
| - / NeuralNetwork.cpp : A simple implementation of neural networks in C++.
| - / GraphAlgorithms.cpp : A collection of graph-related algorithms including Djikstra's Algorithm, Boruvka’s Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm and Graph Traversals in C++.
| - / GNN.cpp : An implementation of GNNs in C++.

Future Goals : 
Extend these algorithms to SystemVerilog / VHDL in order to program them to FPGAs and understand how they are trained / tested on them.
