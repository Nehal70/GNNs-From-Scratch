# GNNs-From-Scratch
Classical Algorithms like Linear Regression, Deep Learning Algorithms like Neural Networks, GNNs, etc. from scratch in Python and C++.<br>

I'm using this repository as a crash course to learning about GNNs in depth. As part of the process, I plan on implementing Linear Regression, Neural Networks, Djikstra's Algorithm, Boruvka’s Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Graph Traversals and GNNs. I am using Python to develop a quick, pseudo-code like implementation of these algorithms since I am comfortable with the language and will use this as a method to refresh the concepts. Later, I will use C++ in order to learn the language and work my skill up to building a GNN from scratch in C++. <br>

Future Goals : <br>
Extend these algorithms to SystemVerilog / VHDL in order to program them to FPGAs and understand how they are trained / tested on them.
